# IPL_Spark_Analysis
# INTRODUCTION

This project leverages PySpark, a distributed data processing engine, to perform scalable analysis of IPL match data. The data is read from an AWS S3 bucket and contains detailed ball-by-ball information such as batting team, bowling team, runs scored, wickets taken, and more. The objective is to derive meaningful insights—such as top-performing players, team statistics, seasonal trends, and dismissal patterns—through data wrangling, aggregation, and visualization in a Spark environment.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Indian Premier League (IPL) generates vast amounts of cricket match data every season, covering every ball, player, and outcome. This data, if analyzed effectively, can uncover key performance metrics and strategic insights. The challenge is to process large-scale IPL data stored in CSV format using PySpark and derive valuable information about team and player performances across different seasons.

# SUMMARY INSIGHTS

## Top Run Scorers (Batsmen):

●  Players with the highest cumulative runs over seasons.

●  Rankings possibly based on total runs or average runs per innings.

## Best Bowlers (by Wickets):

●  Most wickets taken, possibly by filtering on dismissal types like bowled, caught, lbw, etc.

●  Additional stats may include economy rate and average wickets per match.

## Team Performances:

●  Wins per season or across all seasons.

●  Margins of victory and most successful teams historically.

## Match Outcomes:

●  Breakdown of matches won by batting first vs. chasing.

●  Matches won due to toss advantage or specific toss decisions.

## Seasonal Trends:

●  Increase or decrease in scoring rates.

●  Any patterns in player performances across different seasons.

## Dismissal Analysis:

●  Common dismissal types (e.g., caught, bowled, run out).

●  Teams or players more prone to specific dismissals.

## Venue/City Insights:

●  Cities with highest scoring games.

●  Venues that favor bowlers vs. batsmen.

# CONCLUSION

By utilizing PySpark, this project successfully demonstrates how big data tools can be applied to sports analytics. The analysis provides actionable insights into IPL dynamics—like top scorers, effective bowlers, and consistent teams. This scalable approach allows analysts and franchises to make data-driven decisions in real time, ultimately enhancing strategies, performance predictions, and fan engagement.
